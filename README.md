# Schedule editor in CRON line format

This application is a user-friendly UI. It allows you to easily create CRON lines in a convenient format for scheduling tasks and automating repetitive actions. The application has the ability to scale both the user interface and the server side.

I developed this app as a test assignment for [Convermax](https://convermax.com/).
